# Notebooks for Figures
This directory contains the notebooks for generating figures custom made for the thesis (mostly chapter 1 and 2).
It does not contain notebooks (or other tools) used to generate figures included in previous publications (mostly chapter 3-5).

To interact with the notebooks, create a new virtual environment and install the `requirements.txt`.
Then run `jupyter notebook`.
